Countdown provides a window on your desktop, counting for a specific date.

By default, it counts to 2025.6.7, the University entrance exam in China.

# UI Behaviors
Countdown hovers **15 pixels** from the **top right corner** of your primary display.

It automatically adapts to your scaling (Thanks to the powerful [qt](https://qt.io)).

The geometry (position and size) is currently NOT adjustable.

You cannot move, resize, minimize/maximize or close the window.

The program creates a tray icon, which contains a "config" to your config file (Windows only) and "Quit".

# Configuration
Click on the 'å¤©' character on the bottom right to expand or fold settings panel.

Here you can set the date to count to and whether the window is Translucent (or, transparent) (Requires restart).

Other options can only be edited from `consistent.ini`.
You can find it in the program directory after launching it for the very first time.

## Style
The default stylesheet in config:
```ini
[widget]
Stylesheet=".QWidget{ background-color: white; border-radius: 10px; } .QLabel{ color:black }"
```

To get a better visual effect, it's suggested to edit it like this:
```ini
[widget]
Stylesheet=".QWidget{ background-color: rgba(255,255,255,180); border-radius: 10px; } .QLabel{ color:black }"
```
The format is acturally qss. Check [Qt Online Help Document (EN)](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/stylesheet.html), [csdn(1)](https://blog.csdn.net/zwcslj/article/details/140154933) or [csdn(2)](https://blog.csdn.net/martian665/article/details/142520397) for more details.

The base widget's name is `centralwidget`. **Note** that almost all components are children of QWidget, so you should use `.QWidget` instead of `QWidget` if you don't want to adapt it to everything. Check for names in ui file. For a more friendly interaction, try qtcreator or designer.
